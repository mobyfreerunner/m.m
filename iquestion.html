          <light> An application inspired by the Intelligence Amplification notion proposed by Vernor Vinge. iQuestion turns knowledge into an economy allowing users to contribute to a database of knowledge that other users can go to to learn.

      </section>
      <section class="section">
        <p class="par">This is my capstone project for my Masters of Design in Interaction Design at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. It was an individual design project where we had to come up with a concept and go through the design process, including research and the final prototype. We had the entirety of the final semester to work on this individually.</p>

      </section>
      <section class="section">
        <p class="par">Beginning with an interest in Artificial Intelligence and its place in the world of Interaction Design I was interested in the idea of making a project that was a commentary on the way we use our technology.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="section">
        <p class="par">My research into the actual implications of AI lead me to a very interesting paper that I read by Vernor Vinge on “The coming Technological Singularity”. He came up with this idea of an alternative to AI he called IA (Intelligence Amplification). This was the improvement of our own intelligence by strengthening the way we communicate with computers and making it more seamless. In this way we would be able to effectively “amplify” our intelligence, because the machines systems will become extensions of ourselves.</p>

      </section>
      <section class="section">
        <p class="par">I was intrigued with how we search for information we were interested in. How did we learn on the internet? What were the “search” habits of users and how did they go about to gain knowledge on the internet? Services like Quora and StackExchange provided a platform where users could go to seek knowledge. As a designer who codes, I have spent hours lurking on websites like these in search for answers.</p>

      </section>
      <section class="section">
        <p class="par">I began my research by having candid conversations with the people around me about Artificial Intelligence. I also consumed as much media as I could about AI and read papers written by futurists and scientists about the idea of the coming singularity.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="section">
        <p class="par">I learned a few key things from this:</p>
      </section>
      <section class="section">
        <ul class="secList">
          <li><span>People do not trust responsibilities into computers and Artificial Intelligence.</span></li>
          <li> <span>People are fascinated by AI but still do not fully understand it</span></li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="section">
        <p class="par">During this preliminary investigation I was also very curious as to how people treated their devices. One behaviour in particular I was interested in was the personification of their devices.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="section">
        <p class="par">approached the idea of doing a critical design of an object that would in a sense poke fun of the fact that it was just a machine. Because I noticed that people often personified their devices when frustrated with it, I wanted to give our smart devices something that would bring them closer to being human, and that was the imperfections of making mistakes and awareness. HAL9000 one of the most famous AI in Science Fiction culture was anthropomorphised by the simple fact that it made a mistake and was trying to cover it up. This was the premise of this idea.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="section">
        <p class="par">Eventually I pulled away from this because I realised that I was becoming too focused on the technology of AI instead of the user.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="section">
        <p class="par">My research lead me to Vernor Vinge and his paper “The coming Technological Singularity” and intelligence amplification. It was at this point I decided to create an app to allow users to exchange knowledge as currency.</p>

      </section>
      <section class="section">
        <p class="par">I was doing my ideation while I was conducting research. In hindsight this might have been a mistake because I started over a few times because of flawed reasoning. One of which was the realisation that I was designing for a technological concept rather than the user.</p>

      <section class="section">
        <p class="par">This project was rife with obstacles. Most of which were encountered and overcome during the design process of iQuestion. At the start, the very premise of the project was flawed because I approached it with Artificial Intelligence in mind. I learned that AI was more of an engineering term and not something that I could treat as a “feature” of an application I was meant to design and prototype.</p>

        <p class="par">As an advocate for user centric design and empathetic design philosophy, I suddenly realised that I needed to take a huge step back from my project and re-evaluate the problem that I was trying to solve from a human focused approach.
