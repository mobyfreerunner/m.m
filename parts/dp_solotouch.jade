      strong description:
      light  SoloTouch is a musical instrument designed for novice musicians to play impressive guitar solos. The instrument features a touch controller for playing notes that always sound "right", and an optional iPhone interface to add variety to the music.

    h2.header_3 Context
    
  section.section
    p.par SoloTouch is my second project under LUME, a research program aimed at creating musical interfaces for individuals with special needs. In this project, I partnered with Mubarak Marafa to design an instrument for those who lack access to formal musical training.

    h2.header_2 Motivation
    
  section.section
    p.par As a drum instructor, I have always dreamed of a way for non-musicians to enjoy playing music without having to learn complex music theories and techniques.
    
  section.section
    p.par We believe by automating the complexity of music playing, anyone could perform great music with minimum training.

    h2.header_3 Identifying Challenges
    
  section.section
    p.par We began by looking at challenges faced by novice musicians today. Based on some informal interviews and my own experience as a music instructor, we have identified two of the most common difficulties:
    
  section.section
    ul.secList
      li
        span <strong>Note selection</strong> — Difficulty in finding the ‘right notes’ to play.
      li 
        span <strong>Physical control</strong> — Difficulty in handling an instrument.
        
  section.section
    p.par I believe a successful instrument should not only be user-friendly, but also expressive; therefore our design goal was to strike a balance between ease of use and expressiveness.

  section.section
    h2.header_3 Auto-Note Selection
    
  section.section
    p.par <strong>Challenge:</strong> Finding harmonic notes to a song (aka. the ‘right notes’) is difficult as it requires understanding of musical concepts like scales and keys.
    
  section.section
    p.par <strong>Solution:</strong> A software system that automatically selects notes in a scale, so players don’t have to learn them.
    
  section.section
    p.par Using the visual programming tool Max, I experimented with various system concepts before settling on one that allowed players to combine different short phrases into unique melodies.

  section.section
    p.par To easily switch between phrases, I also made a (pretty terrible) controller interface on the iPhone using TouchOSC.

    h2.header_2 Design
    
  section.section
    p.par <strong>Challenge:</strong> Vibrato — the pulsating change of pitch, is an essential technique used for playing expressive music. However, performing vibrato on traditional instruments can be difficult, especially for beginners.
    
  section.section
    p.par <strong>Solution:</strong> A pivoting touch surface that plays a note on touch and bends its pitch when pushed further, offering an easy gesture for playing vibrato.

    p.par With Mubarak’s 3D modeling skills, we modeled and printed our first hardware prototype using the school’s newly installed 3D printer.
    
  section.section
    p.par Seeing our design come to life was an unforgettable moment, but it also uncovered engineering problems that did not exist in software. We tackled these problems one at a time across multiple iterations.

    h3.quote Seeing our design come to life was an unforgettable moment, but it also uncovered engineering problems that did not exist in software.
    
  section.section
    p.par <strong>Problem #1:</strong> Insert both axles into the touch platform required splitting the case into two pieces, which would collapse easily under force.
    
  section.section
    div.diagram
      img.picGal.flexerHeight(src="../../assets/img/dp_solotouch/prototype2.jpg")
      
  section.section
    p.par <strong>Solution:</strong> We replaced the axles with a long metal rod, allowing us to design a unibody case. (We spent days looking for such rod, and finally found the perfect one in a toy car.)

  section.section
    p.par <strong>Problem #2:</strong> We needed a sensor to capture the platform’s rotation, unfortunately our gear + potentiometer mechanism didn’t work so well.

  section.section
    p.par <strong>Solution:</strong> Just before demo day I made a workaround simply by taping a flex sensor underneath the platform and converted its flex angle as input. Surprisingly we've achieved similar results with a much simpler solution.

    h2.header_3 System: Redesigned
    
  section.section
    p.par We received very positive feedback for our hardware but many people found the software too complicated to learn. In response to that, I bit the bullet and redesigned the system from scratch.
    
  section.section
    p.par <strong>Challenge:</strong> Advanced players preferred more controls and options, whereas beginners were overwhelmed by options.
    
  section.section
    p.par <strong>Solution:</strong> A beginner-focused system that played basic solos using only the touch controller, with an optional iPhone UI for advanced players to add musical variety. This supported both user groups as well as striking a perfect balance between ease of use and user expressiveness.
    
  section.section
    p.par Finally, we named our instrument the <em>SoloTouch</em>.

    h2.header_3 Outcome
    
  section.section
    p.par SoloTouch was very well received by a broad range of audiences and became a huge success.Our paper on SoloTouch was published by NIME, one of the most renowned music HCI conferences, followed by a trip to Korea for a demo and poster session.

    h2.header_2 Reflections and Learnings
  
  section.section
    p.par SoloTouch was one of my first design projects. It was truly an encouragement to achieve such success from an early attempt in design, one that allowed me to set a high bar for future projects. Looking back at the design, I would definitely improve upon the learnability of our system, perhaps even removing the iPhone controller altogether for further simplicity.
    
  section.section
    p.par I am glad to have gotten our hands on an actual 3D-printed model during the design process, as it enabled us to uncover issues that would not have otherwise been found, leading to the iterative designs that made the final product so much better.
